# Skype Killer

Not being able to control whether or not visitors to a website would see the 
styles added by the Skype 'Click to Call' plugin was starting to quite annoy me.

The CSS in this repo does its best to reverse the styling added by Skype.

So far it's been tested with Firefox and Chrome on Windows only, and success is
likely to be highly dependent on the website's other CSS.

Feedback, bug fixes or improvements are most welcome.
